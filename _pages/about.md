I am a Research Fellow at [PROSE, Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/).
Prior to this, I was a Software Development Engineer at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/in/), where I worked in the Adobe Experience Manager Guides team.

In 2022, I graduated from [IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in) with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Social Sciences (with Hons). I was awarded the `All Round Performance Award` and the `Institute Silver Medal` for best academic performance in my cohort. I completed my bachelor's thesis under the guidance of [Dr. Jainendra Shukla, IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/jainendra) and [Dr. Aniket Bera, UMD](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/bera). 

In 2021, I was awarded the [Adobe India Women in Tech Scholarship](https://www.adobe.com/in/lead/creativecloud/women-in-technology.html), amongst 6 scholars pan India. I also received the [GHC Student Scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/scholarships/student/) by AnitaB.Org.

During my undergraduate, I interned at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com) and undertook various research projects at the [PAG](https://pag.iiitd.edu.in), [HMI](https://hmi.iiitd.edu.in), [MIDAS](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in), and [NewsLab](https://newsinitiative.iiitd.edu.in/team.html) in the domains of Program Analysis, HCI, Causality and Interpretability, and Digital Journalism.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
