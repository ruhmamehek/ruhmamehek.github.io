## **Industry Research Experience**
---

### Research Fellow at [PROSE, Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/)

---

### Research Intern at Big Data Experience Labs, [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com)

Research Domains: `Human-in-the-loop`, `active learning`, `multimodal document tasks` 

- Achieved **42%** improvement in the accuracy of existing AI used for accessibilty tagging of PPTs using human-in-the-loop techniques
- Improved the model accuracy by **30%** for brochures by building a novel pipeline to propagate the human feedback and improve the model performance iteratively
- Built a prototype of the pipeline using PyTorch and Flask

### Bachelor's Thesis, [HMI](https://hmi.iiitd.edu.in), IIITD

Research Domains: `HCI`, `co-speech gestures`, `gendered gestures`, `perception study`<br>
Advisors: [Dr. Jainendra Shukla, IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/jainendra) and [Dr. Aniket Bera, UMD](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/bera)

- Prepared **Mudra**, a systematically curated multimodal Hindi co-speech gesture dataset of **43.62 hours** of videos and extracted poses, transcripts and audio features
- Aimed to build a GAN to generate culture and gender influenced coâ€‘speech gestures for a conversing virtual agent
- Conducted pilot studies and statistical analysis to confirm gender and culture influences in co-speech gestures
- Used CNN & Deep Feedforward neural network to extract and represent gender as a spectrum

### Independent Project, [MIDAS](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in) & [Adobe MDSR Lab](https://research.adobe.com)

Research Domains: `Causality`, `Interpretable AI`<br>
Advisors: [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html), [Dr. Jayakumar Subramaniam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayakumar-subramanian-9198954/)  

- Project in collaboration with Adobe Media and Data Science Research Lab, Noida, India
- Estimated the uncertainty when answering queries in the absence of a true causal graph
- Compared and analysed the various structure learning algorithms and evaluation metrics and built a query based ensemble to output best algorithm given a query on a dataset
